# mise-en-place

Welcome to my dot files, configuration files and other things that make up my workplace setup before cooking some code (French: [mise-en-place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mise_en_place), a term coined by the amazing [@andim](https://www.github.com/andim)) :)

I am currently switching from bash to [fish](https://fishshell.com/) as my default shell.
