# mise-en-place

Welcome to my dot files, configuration files and other things that make up my workplace setup before cooking some code (French: [mise-en-place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mise_en_place), a term coined by the amazing [@andim](https://www.github.com/andim)) :)

## Cloning this repo
Make sure to clone this repo with `git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:mu-gaimann/mise-en-place.git` in order to fetch all submodules that are used.

## OS

I am currently using Mint, but I will change to Ubuntu in the long term.

## Shell

I am currently switching from bash to [fish](https://fishshell.com/) with the [oh-my-fish](https://github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish) framework as my default shell.

My current theme is [tide](https://github.com/IlanCosman/tide).

## Fonts

I currently use Meslo Nerd Fonts.

## Tmuxinator

I am using the `.tmux.config` dotfile from [gpakosz](https://github.com/gpakosz/.tmux), and a custom `.tmux.config.local` file.
It is installed by default into a folder named ~/repos/ and then symlinked.

## SSH Keys

There is a script that automates the generation and exchange of SSH keys between a remote and local.

## Manual items

- Terminal: change the fonts in the preferences of your terminal to a Nerd Font (e.g. MesloLGS NF). 
- Install JetBrains IDEs using the [JetBrains Toolbox](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/toolbox/).

## To Do
- replace Meslo Nerd Font with a font that correctly displays powerline symbols.
